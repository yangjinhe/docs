<br/>



## **Custom upload part size**

The upload part size (bytes) can be customized by the user, and if there is a performance issue, please adjust it yourself. Set '0' to 100 MB by default.

- The current upload part size on the web is 20 MB (20971520).

- The [EOS documentation](https://ecloud.10086.cn/op-help-center/api/article/40933) used by the new version of the Personal Cloud states that "objects larger than > 5 GB cannot be uploaded", so the upload part size should not exceed 5 GB.

## **Other**

- Other information is taken from the request, which has changed from cookie to obtaining `Authorization`
  - The new personal cloud can be obtained in another way. See the picture example of [Personal new](#personal-new)
