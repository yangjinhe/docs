## **Tips**

1. Are you worried that visitors can see all files? [**Click to see how to set it up here**](../../faq/why.md#how-do-i-set-it-so-that-visitors-can-only-see-the-content-after-logging-in)

2. **`Guest user is disabled, login please`**: In order to protect your AList security, the guest access permission is closed, if you need guest access, open it yourself 
   - AList Manage --> users --> `guest` -->  **Disable** uncheck
   
3. Question about **`Copy/Upload`**

   - If you upload (including offline download and upload) large files, or upload a lot of files (hundreds or thousands), it is not recommended to use AList to operate, please go to the corresponding network disk official website to operate directly
   
4. Non-admin users can manage offline download, copy, upload and other operations in the background
   - AList needs to be upgraded to <Badge text="v3.39.1" type="info" vertical="middle" /> version, and admin can also view the user's task progress and operations
